# ~ Lessons for Other People ~

###### &sect; Introduction
A little about my time at ML and the motivation for this piece. Also, maybe a thesis would be nice.

###### &sect; Creep and Retreat
There's a phenomenon in consumer economics known as [*feature creep*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep): the tendency for products to accumulate new features beyond the point of usefulness, desirablity, and sometimes sanity. Your remote control is probably an instructive example. I count 61 buttons on mine, excluding those with multiple degrees-of-freedom or combinations involving the `SHIFT` key. I'm not certain how many I actually use, but considerably fewer than that. For sure.

I own this monstrosity because there's often a significant gap between what we actually want or need a product to do and what we require of a product in order for it to be considered enticing in the marketplace. If you ask professional DVD remote engineer to design a DVD remote, there's a good chance you'll end up with something bananas. A professional DVD remote engineer must satisfy not only your actual consumer needs, but also your *perceived* consumer needs &mdash; needs that are sometimes created right there on the spot for the sole purpose of being immediately satisfied.[^murrica] And so you end up with a contraption that lets you watch your movies backwards at three-quarter speed with Esperanto subtitles rotated 90&deg; clockwise. Because the professional DVD remote engineer knows, from experience, that given the choice between *that* contraption and one that only lets you watch your movies backwards at three-quarter speed with Esperanto subtitles in *unrotated* text,[^sucker] you'll pick the first one nine times out of ten. Especially if they're right next to each other on store shelves. Which, of course, they are.

If, on the other hand, you ask an average user to design his or her own personal DVD remote, you'll likely end up with buttons that (exhaustively) play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward, skip chapters, and eject. You'll end up with (only) those buttons because they cover 99% of use cases for a normal human being who wants to watch a DVD on planet Earth.

In other words, the things we want to use and the things we want to buy are often very different. Of course what we want to *buy* wins out &mdash; almost by definition &mdash; and so we're stuck with products that are easy to desire but hard to wield. Like a hoarder who's convinced that someone, someday, will desperately require that terrarium full of bottle caps, we end up buried under the ghosts of hypothetical need.[^cat]

Curricular materials are consumer products. They suffer from the same gap and are subject to the same pressure. Except the curriculum situation is a little worse, because the pressure can operate bidirectionally. For some consumers, features creep in the ordinary way: they see materials with more scaffolding, more steps, more structure, and think they're getting a bargain. The apparent bang/buck ratio gets high enough that the bucks seem justified. As a result, you get lessons or activities that feel increasingly stifling, claustrophobic, overdetermined. Hands are tipped too early. The author or teacher is doing work that might be better left to the student.

But for a certain subset of consumers, many of those same features scan as bugs. When these folks evaluate materials, their internal voices whisper things like: [*Be less helpful*](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2009/asilomar-4-be-less-helpful/). They want activities that students can shape to their own thinking. They want lesson structures to emerge organically rather than come fully formed, hard-coded by the creator. They want to offer a simple prompt and watch the class [notice and wonder](http://mathforum.org/workshops/universal/documents/notice_wonder_intro.pdf) its way to discovery. They want...less. But then teachers end up working in a potentially uncomfortable space with very little in the way of lumbar support. The specter of amorphous time looms large. Planning for ill-defined eventualities gets hard quickly. Let's call this phenomenon *feature retreat*.

The important point is this: in either case features are being pushed in the wrong direction, or at least too far in one of those directions.  Assuming there's some optimal level of structure/scaffolding/buttressing, creep and retreat both urge users toward products they'll find problematic in the wild, and authors find themselves struggling to toe an impossibly thin line between adequate support and adequate flexibility. All while trying to make "adequate" seem marketable.

Here's what I see as the fundamental &mdash; and potentially unresolvable &mdash; problem of curriculum design: it might be impossible to right-size the feature list for math lessons on anything approaching a universal scale. The best that authors can hope for is to provide a structure that's easily adaptable by an individual teacher as she feels around for her own personal feature list in real time.

###### &sect; Chasing Waterfalls
I said "the best" back there as if it were well defined, but &mdash; even in such a narrow sense &mdash; that's pretty obviously dumb. Sell sheets for curricular materials are longer than one sentence precisely because they claim to solve a bunch of pedagodical problems simultaneously. If a product aspires to serious consideration, it has to do more than rescue individual teachers from having to create all their own stuff[^stuff] &mdash; regardless of how much opportunity there is for arbitrary customization, or how easy that opportunity is to realize.

One other thing you're ostensibly paying for is some kind of unifying vision. That vision could be methodological ([the *Discovering Mathematics* series](https://www.kendallhunt.com/discoveringmathematics/)), schematic ([the Connected Mathematics Project](https://connectedmath.msu.edu/)), philosophical ([TK SOMETHING ELSE]()) &mdash; probably a bunch of other adjectives &mdash; but it's part of what makes a curriculum more than a collection of items.

The ML unifying vision was slightly different (because of modularity), but revolved around narrative unity and purity. In any case, the idea of authorial vision is fundamentally at odds with customization anyway. So here we are in this situation where authors can't (a) write materials with optimal support, or (b) offer too much customization without sacrificing the unifying thread that makes for a coherent user/student experience. (The other issue with customization is that you quickly run into a [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) problem, at which point what are you even selling, dude?)

###### &sect; The Barthes Legacy
One obvious solution to the authorial problem is to simply kill the author.[^violence] Aaaaaaaand then this section explores the issues and consequences related to that.

###### &sect; State of the Art
Tying everything together. Where does this all leave us?
