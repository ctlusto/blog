<h1 class="page-heading">{about}</h1>

I'm currently a mathematical apologist and curriculum developer at [Mathalicious](www.mathalicious.com), a fantastic little company that's rewriting middle and high school math around real-world topics and helping to morph students' daily experiences with math into daily experiences with the *world*, through math. Before that I taught [high school in Minneapolis](www.slpschools.org) for a little while. And before *that* I exploded stuff professionally for the Marine Corps. I occasionally write tidbits about teaching, math, teaching math, and coding for the purpose of teaching math. I'm also an enthusiastic [#MTBoS](www.twitter.com/hashtag/mtbos?src=hash) participant[^1] on Twitter as [@Lustomatical](www.twitter.com/lustomatical).

This is what I look like when I'm holding a tiny frog, which I think sums up several important aspects of my personality in a way words can't:

[^1]:Descended from the Latin *participare* and meaning, literally, "sharing in." I think that's nice. The concept of participation as a personal goal gets rather a lot of abuse &mdash; insert here all sorts of publicly-fashionable handwringing over Millenial coddling, youth soccer trophies, etc. &mdash; but in its bones it's really a lovely idea.
