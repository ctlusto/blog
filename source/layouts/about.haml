        .about-description
            %p I'm currently a mathematical apologist and curriculum developer at <a href="http://mathalicious.com">Mathalicious</a>, a fantastic little company that's rewriting middle and high school math around real-world topics and helping to morph students' daily experiences with math into daily experiences with the <em>world</em>, through math. Before that I taught <a href="http://slpschools.org">high school in Minneapolis</a> for a little while. And before <em>that</em> I exploded stuff professionally for the Marine Corps. I occasionally write tidbits about teaching, math, teaching math, and coding for the purpose of teaching math. I'm also an enthusiastic <a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/mtbos?src=hash">#MTBoS</a> participant<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/lustomatical">@Lustomatical</a>.

            %p This is what I look like when I'm holding a tiny frog, which I think sums up several important aspects of my personality in a way words can't:

                        %p Descended from the Latin <em>participare</em> and meaning, literally, "sharing in." I think that's nice. The concept of participation as a personal goal gets rather a lot of abuse &mdash; insert here all sorts of publicly-fashionable handwringing over Millenial coddling, youth soccer trophies, etc. &mdash; but in its bones it's really a lovely idea. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a>
