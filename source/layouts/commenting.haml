                    I'm easily recognizable in the comments by the HMFIC badge next to my avatar. You can also get my attention via Twitter by including "@Lustomatical" somewhere in your comment text.

                    Comments from users with a verified email address post automatically. To help keep the spammers at bay, comments from mysterious Internet entities require moderator approval. If you want your comments to post immediately and not have them languish in my inbox for potentially infuriating periods of time, take the two seconds to <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/960202-verifying-your-disqus-account">verify your email with Disqus</a>. (N.B. As a further spam-killing measure, any comments that include links also require approval, regardless of the originating address.)

                    It's a bare-minimum requirement. Notice that I didn't say "friendliess," or even "politeness." Civility is an extremely low bar for adult human interaction; if you can't clear it, kindly comment elsewhere. I hear <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/youtube-commenter-study/">YouTube is cool</a>.

                    I'm a firm believer that a well-placed "fuck" can be rhetorically purposeful, but let's not go overboard. We should strive for professional conversation, even if we're professionals who swear from time to time.

                    If you see something you think is terrible &mdash; even for the Internet &mdash; go ahead and flag it, and it'll generate a notification for me. As a safeguard, in case I'm not available during a particularly vile incident, anything flagged by three people will automatically be hidden until I can review it.

                    I reserve the right to edit your comments. For several reasons, I don't want to do that &mdash; mostly because it's a huge pain in the ass &mdash; but I will if it allows me to salvage what I perceive to be important content that would otherwise have to be removed because it's preceded/followed/surrounded by ugliness.

                    I can remove content for any reason, even if you think that reason is deeply unfair.

                    I write most things with the express purpose of encouraging conversation, which conversation I hope can take place, at least in large part, right here on this very site. But if a thread becomes too difficult/annoying for me to babysit, I may (with deep sadness) close further commenting.
