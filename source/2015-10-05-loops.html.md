# ~ Loops ~
Last week [Dan Meyer announced a contest](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/our-fall-contest-this-is-not-a-math-book/) built around a loopy task from [Anna Weltman](https://twitter.com/annaweltman) in her new non-math math book, [_This is not a Math Book_](http://new.myubam.com/p/5003/this-is-not-a-math-book).

I turned the task into an [interactive walkthrough and loop laboratory](http://dev.chrislusto.com/loops/), which you're cordially invited to use as a demonstration for your students in conjunction with Anna's book (Dan excerpted a few pages [here](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/instructionpage.pdf) and [here](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/instructionpage.pdf)). Or, of course, if you just want to get nerd-sniped into messing around with loops for a little while.

Below I included a couple of problem sets I think would make for interesting extensions.

###### &sect; Faces and Vertices and Edges (Oh, my!)
1. (1) We saw that sometimes a loop only intersects itself at individual points (like the 2-3-4), while other times a loop will retrace a portion of itself (like the 3-5-2). Let's call loops that retrace themselves _clingy_. Under what circumstances will a loop be clingy?

2. (2) A loop divides the plane into a bunch of regions that are walled off from the rest of the plane. Let's call those regions _cells_. How many cells does the 2-1-4 loop have? (Hint: Don't forget the big, huge, giant cell that's outside the whole loop.)

3. (3) Each time a loop intersects itself at a point, it forms a little cross. How many crosses does the 2-1-4 loop have?

4. (4) If you start at a cross and trace your way along the loop, eventually you'll either end up at another cross, or back at the same cross from a new direction. That portion of the loop between two crosses (or between a cross and itself) is called a _blip_. How many blips does the 2-1-4 loop have?

5. (5) Make a whole bunch of non-clingy loops. Can you find a relationship among the number of cells, crosses, and blips that a loop has?

6. (6) Find yourself a cube. How many faces does it have? How many vertices? How many edges?

7. (7) Find yourself a tetrahedron (admittedly a little bit harder). How many faces, vertices, and edges does it have?

8. (8) Get your hands on a bunch of convex polyhedra. (Unless you have some really nerdy math friends, you're probably going to have to [hit up the internet](http://www.amazon.com/Wood-Platonic-Solids/dp/B00I88065A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1444006810&sr=8-2&keywords=wooden+polyhedra) for this one). Can you find a relationship among the number of faces, vertices, and edges each one has?

9. (9) Convince yourself that this connection between loop-de-loops and convex polyhedra isn't an accident.

###### &sect; Loops Gone Wild
1. (1) We looked at some loops with three lengths (3-loops), a loop with four lengths (a 4-loop), and a loop with five lengths (a 5-loop). The 3-loops all returned to their starting point, so let's call them _tame_. (The 5-loop was also tame.) But the 4-loop spun off to infinity. Let's call loops like that _wild_. Are there any wild 3-loops? Prove there aren't or find a counterexample.

2. (2) Are there any tame 4-loops? If so, are there any that a snooty mathematician wouldn't call _trivial_? Why or why not?

3. (3) For what _n_ are _n_-loops guaranteed to be tame? Guaranteed to be wild? Neither necessarily tame nor necessarily wild?

4. (4) Let's say that, instead of always changing direction in a counterclockwise way, at each step you pick a random direction (up, down, left, or right) in which to draw your line. Let's call this new kind of loop a _drunken_ loop. Are drunken 3-loops more likely to be wild then their sober counterparts? Are drunken 4-loops more likely to be tame?

5. (5) Remarkably (to me, at least), any drunken 1-loop (like 1-1-1-... or 9-...) is tame. Prove that there are no wild drunken 1-loops.

6. (6) Instead of restricting our loops to a 2D grid, let's have them live in a 3D lattice. Now a drunken loop can head off, at each step, in one of 6 random directions in 3-space. Are all drunken 1-loops still tame? If not, what's the probability a drunken 1-loop will be tame?

7. (7) As _n_ increases, what happens to the probabilty that a drunken 1-loop is tame in _R<sup>n</sup>_? Come up with a formula for that probability in terms of _n_.
